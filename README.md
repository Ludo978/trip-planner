# Trip planner

This is a project I made for my master's degree. It's a simple API that allows you to look for bars, restaurants, hotels and other places of interest in a city. You can create an account, add bookmarks and rate places.

It's made following a microservice architecture. It uses node.js, mongoDB, express, docker and jest for the unit tests.
